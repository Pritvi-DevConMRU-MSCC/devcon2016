        ... and choosing the right venue(s) might be essential for the success of our Developers Conference.

    <p>
        During the day it might be a bit more focused on actual technologies and lots of sessions but nonetheless it's
        also important to switch off in the evening. What could be better than joining the speakers and
        other conference attendees for a round of networking and exchange of experience after the official part?
        Apart from the technical talks we are going to compliment the conference with some <a ui-sref="extras">Extras</a> and
        side activities after the official hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are looking forward to welcome you for this year's Developer Conference at two exquisite locations.
