    <p>
        Working with computers is bound to typing your source code, specifications or any kind of documentation via keyboard since decades.
        New alternatives like speech recognition are still in their early phase of development and practical use. Which leads us ultimately
        to the following questions:
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you know about touch-typing or speedtyping? How good are your skills?
    </p>
    <p>
        Show us and other participants your impressive speedtyping skills and compete among each other in various competitions and races.
        The typing speed is usually measured in words-per-minute (WPM), and a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes.

    <p>
        The next version of Ubuntu is highly anticipated with its continuous development towards an unified user experience on the
        desktop, on the server, in the cloud, or on the mobile platform. Welcome the Internet of Things (IoT).
    </p>
    <p>
        Mark Shuttleworth introduced the new version Ubuntu and its foray into the mobile space some months back:
        <blockquote><em>"This is a time when every electronic thing can be an Internet thing, and that’s a chance for us to bring our platform, with its security and its long term support, to a vast and important field. In a world where almost any device can be smart, and also subverted, our shared efforts to make trusted and trustworthy systems might find fertile ground."</em></blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        Bring your laptop or USB pendrives to receive a copy of the latest incarnation of Ubuntu, and step into a world of
        open source.

        You are more of a hardware geek? You like to pull up your sleeves and get cracking with single-board computers (SBC)
        like the Raspberry Pi, the Arduino, or other models? Then the maker space will be the right place to demo your
        Do-It-Yourself (DIY) projects to the rest of the audience.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Networking &amp; Community<br /><span class="muted">Communication and exchange with others</span></h2>
    <p>
        Communication with your environment is an essential part of everyone's life. And it doesn't matter
        whether you are actually living in a rural area in the middle of nowhere, within the pulsating heart
        of a big city, or in my case on a wonderful island in the Indian Ocean. The ability to exchange your thoughts,
        your experience and your worries with another person helps you to get different points of view and new
        ideas on how to resolve an issue you might be confronted with.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take the chance to exchange with other attendees in the reception area or on the balcony. Have some interesting
        conversations about software development, latest information gained during one of the presentations and let others
        know about your ups &amp; downs in your projects.
    </p>
