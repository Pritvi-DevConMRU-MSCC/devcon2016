    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Why is Developers Conference unique?</h2>
    <p class="">
        One of the major aims of the MSCC is to be technology-agnostic. And the Developers Conference therefore offers a wide range of topics,
        a large number of speakers - local and international, but also the participants and the ease of discussion. Among the participants,
        we find young professionals, students and enthusiasts as well as influencers and managers of both the public and the private sectors
        of Mauritius.
    </p>
    <p class="">
        Mauritius as destination is the connection point between Africa and Asia in the Indian Ocean, and the role of IT, BPO and knowledge
        handling is key to get the best of both continents.
